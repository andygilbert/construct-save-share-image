# construct-save-share-image
Construct plugin to allow native builds (iOS and Android) image saving and sharing on iOS and Android.

## How does this differ from the "official plugin"?
The official plugin currently only offers to share text and URL links due to compatability requirements with Web API.

## What builds does this plugin work on?
Only Native iOS and Android builds. It does not work for HTML5 web builds.
